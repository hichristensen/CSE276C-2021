        <h2>Mathematics for Robotics</h2>

        <p><br />
          Fall 2021, T-Th 3:30-4:50 PM, @ PCYNH 120<br />
          Professor: Henrik I Christensen, Office hours: Thursdays 9-11<br />
          TAs: Quan Vuong - qvuong@ucsd.edu <br />
        </p>
        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

        <p>This is an introductory graduate class so a minimum of formal
          requirements are assumed beyond an ability to program.</p>

        <h2>Piazza</h2>

        <p>We will be using Piazza for class communication/discussions, so
          you should get an enrollment email from them. Please do sign up and
          check it out.  The URL for the Piazza site is
          <a href="https://piazza.com/eng.ucsd/fall2021/cse276c">here</a></p>

        <h2>Emailing about the class:</h2>

        <p>Please use piazza as much as possible, but if you must email me,
          please be sure to use "CSE276C" in the subject line, automatically
          done by clicking this
          link:
          <a href="mailto:hichristensen@ucsd.edu?subject=CSE276C">hichristensen@ucsd.edu</a>
        </p>

        <h2>Class Goals</h2>
 
        <p>The desired learning outcomes for the students are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Understand the geometry of linear systems of equations,
            including null spaces, row spaces and column
            spaces. Understand eigenvalues, diagonalization, singular
            value decomposition, least-squares solutions. Apply these
            skills to infer rigid-body transformations from data.</li>
          <li>Learn how to model data using interpolation, linear
            regression, and higher-order approximation
            methods. Consider these skills to recognize objects from
            point-cloud data.</li>
          <li>Understand different methods for finding roots of
            equations, in one dimension and higher, including
            bisection, Newton's method, Mueller's method. Develop
            skills to analyze convergence rates.</li>
          <li>Generalize finite-dimensional linear algebra concepts
            such as orthogonal bases to perform function
            approximation.</li>
          <li>Develop techniques for solving differential equations
            numerically.</li>
          <li>Understand optimization techniques such as gradient
            descent, conjugate gradient, Newton's method. Learn the
            basics of convex optimization. Consider obstacle-avoidance
            viewed as cost-minimization.</li>
          <li>Develop methods from the Calculus of Variations for
            higher-order optimization. Apply these techniques to
            develop the Lagrangian dynamics of a robot
            manipulator.</li>
          <li>Learn basic computational geometry techniques, such as
            Convex Hull and Voronoi diagrams. Implement a geometric
            robot motion planner.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Textbook</h2>

        The two texts that we will draw from are:
        <ul>
          <li>W. H. Press, B. P. Flannery, S. A. Teukolsky, and
            W. T. Vetterling. Numerical Recipes in C. Cambridge University
            Press. (Any edition.)</li>
          <li> T. Bewley, <a href="http://numerical-renaissance.com/">
              Numerical Renaissance: simulation, optimization, &
              control (website)</a></li>
        </ul>
        A good alternative is also 
        <ul> 
          <li> M. Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, and C. Soon Ong,
            "Mathematics for Machine Learning",
            <a href="https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf">PDF
            is available here</a>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Assignments (20% each)</h2>

        <p>There will be five assignments, spaced throughout the quarter,
          each covering different aspects of the material. We will use Canvas
          for submission of assignments.
          <a href="https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/30752">The CANVAS site</a>
          <br /> <br /> 
          <ul>
            <li>We will cover different aspects of the material some
	      of them can be solved directly on paper others will
	      require basic programming in python or matlab</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Participation in Class:</h2>

        <p>To encourage interaction, there is a 5% participation
          grade, allowing to get up to 5% extra credit for engaging in
          class dialogue and on Piazza (e.g., answering each others
          questions, asking questions).</p>

        <h2>Collaboration Policy:</h2>

        <p>Collaboration on assignments is encouraged at the
          "whiteboard" level. That is, share ideas and technical
          conversation, but write your own code. Students are expected
          to abide by the Honor Code. Honest and ethical behavior is
          expected at all times. All incidents of suspected dishonesty
          will be reported to and handled by the Dean of
          Students. </p>

        <h2>Late Policy:</h2>

        <p>1 day late: 75% of the grade, 2 days late: 50% of the grade,
          later than that: 0% of the grade. It is always permissible to ask
          prior approval to hand in an assignment late because of special
          circumstances.</p>

        <h2>Grading:</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Assignments: 100% </li>
          <li>Participation Grade: 5% Extra Credit</li>
        </ul>
